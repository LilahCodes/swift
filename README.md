# Whats going on!!

> [!CAUTION]
> The Swift discord server got terminated in a large scale banwave against executor servers</br>

We are extremely sorry that the new developers hired for swift were so lazy, unresponsive, and delivered on zero of their promises</br>
To rectify this, a new executor completely split from those old developers has been created called Visual</br>
This executor is both owned AND developed by Peyton, ensuring this time you will actually get a quality product (with a dev team who actually gives a shit)</br>
# Join [**Visual**](https://discord.gg/getvisual)</br>
- Visual WILL be compensating those who paid for a lifetime swift key
- Currently Keyless
- Low SUNC at the moment, but EXTREMELY fast development
- Key system will likely be added around 80SUNC, which is when i expect swift lifetime buyers will be compensated (ONLY WITH PURCHASE PROOF)</br>

tldr: Swift got termed, the devs were lazy bums anyway, use visual it is better</br>
