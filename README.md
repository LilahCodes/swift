# Whats going on!!

> [!CAUTION]
> The Swift discord server got terminated in a large scale banwave against executor servers</br>

We are extremely sorry that the new developers hired for swift were so lazy, unresponsive, and delivered on zero of their promises</br>
To rectify this, a new executor completely split from those old developers has been created called Visual</br>
This executor is both owned AND developed by Peyton, ensuring this time you will actually get a quality product (with a dev team who actually gives a shit)</br>

**IF YOU BOUGHT SWIFT LIFETIME, VISUAL WILL COMPENSATE YOU**</br>
