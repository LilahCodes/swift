# ðŸŽ¨ Custom Themes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to create an exclusion for this or it wont work, id recommend just excluding the whole swift folder. 
> If you dont know how, head to [the guide](https://github.com/LilahCodes/swift/blob/main/README.md#how-do-i-disable-my-antivirus)

- Download the [exe](https://github.com/LilahCodes/swift/releases/latest)
- Place in the same folder as Swift
- Launch and follow the instructions
- Have fun with themes!

Still very new, expect bugs. If you find some either lmk on discord or open an issue here.
Synapse theme still in dev, again expect bugs

## Limitations

Currently, the only custom themes you can use are the ones provided here in the themes folder. You dont need to download any of these files, the themer does that for you. We will be taking theme requests from boosters in the [discord](https://discord.gg/getswift), which if accepted will then be uploaded here.
