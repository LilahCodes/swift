# ðŸŽ¨ Custom Themes (UNRELEASED)

To use custom themes: 
- Head to [releases](https://github.com/LilahCodes/swift/releases)
- Download the latest SwiftThemer.exe file
- Place it inside your swift folder
- Run SwiftThemer.exe

---
## Features

- Auto updating
- Backs up your swift key as swift sometimes just forgets it?? If you randomly get logged out, grab ur key from the backup file and re-enter it

## Limitations

Currently, the only custom themes you can use are the ones provided here in the themes folder. You dont need to download any of these files, the themer does that for you. We will be taking theme requests from boosters in the [discord](https://discord.gg/getswift), which if accepted will then be uploaded here.
